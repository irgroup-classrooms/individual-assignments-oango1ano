The old wisdom born out of the west was forsaken. Kings made tombs more splendid than the houses of the living and counted the old names of their descent, dearer than the names of their sons. Childless lords sat in aged halls musing on heraldry or in high, cold towers asking questions of the stars. And so the people of Gondor fell into ruin. The line of Kings failed.

2207,Sam,You don't see it do you? He's a villain.,The Return of the King
2208,Frodo,We can't do this by ourselves Sam. Not without a guide. I need you on my side.,The Return of the King

2220,Gandalf,"Escaped, or was set loose and now the Ring has drawn him here, He won't ever be rid of his need for it. He hates and loves the Ring, as he hates and loves himself.

2221,Frodo,It's a pity Bilbo didnt kill him when he had the chance,The Fellowship of the Ring
2222,Gandalf,"Pity? It was pity that stayed Bilbo's hand. Many that live deserve death and many that die, deserve life. Can you give it to them Frodo? Do not be too eager to deal out death and judgement Even the very wise cannot see all ends. My heart tells me that Gollum has some part to play, yet for good or ill.... before this is over. The pity of Bilbo, may rule the fate of many",The Fellowship of the Ring
2223,Frodo,I wish the Ring had never come to me. I wish none of this had happened.,The Fellowship of the Ring
2224,Gandalf,"So do all who live to see such times, but that is not for them to decide. All we have to decide is what to do with the time that is given to us. There are other forces at work in this world, Frodo, besides the will of evil. Bilbo was meant to find the Ring, in which case you also were meant to have it and that is an encouraging thought. Oh! Its that way",The Fellowship of the Ring

I know I don't look it, but I'm beginning to feel it in my heart. I feel thin, sort of stretched like butter scraped over too much bread. I need a holiday, a very long holiday.

2349,Gan Dalf,"His defeat at Helm's Deep showed our enemy one thing. He knows the Heir of Elendil has come forth, Men are not as weak as he supposed. There is courage still. Strength enough, perhaps, to challenge him. Sauron fears this. He will not risk the peoples of Middle Earth uniting under one banner. He will raze Minas Tirith to the ground, before he sees a King return to the throne of men. If the beacons of Gondor are lit Rohan must be ready for war.",The Return of the King
